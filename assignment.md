# eXtended Reality Prototyping Assignment 2024

"Quest:SDG - Extended Reality for Sustainable Development"

![](images/questsdg.png)

For this assignment, you will demonstrate your creativity and technical competency with Godot and XR development by creating an interactive experience inspired by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Your project must be deployed to an XR headset, or mobile device and should educate, engage, or inspire action around one or more of the 17 SDGs.

This assignment builds on the Quest:SDG project developed over summer. You may choose to:

- **Extend Quest:SDG**: Add new features, goals, interactions, or systems to the existing project

- **Create a standalone experience**: Build your own SDG-focused XR application from scratch

Projects can be completed **individually or in teams of up to 3 students**.

## The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
1. No Poverty
2. Zero Hunger
3. Good Health and Well-being
4. Quality Education
5. Gender Equality
6. Clean Water and Sanitation
7. Affordable and Clean Energy
8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
10. Reduced Inequalities
11. Sustainable Cities and Communities
12. Responsible Consumption and Production
13. Climate Action
14. Life Below Water
15. Life on Land
16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
17. Partnerships for the Goals

## Project Ideas

- Must use version control (git) throughout development with regular commits
- Must meaningfully address at least one UN SDG (educational, awareness-raising, or action-oriented)
- Must utilize XR-specific features (hand tracking, spatial audio, 3D UI, passthrough, etc.)
- Should demonstrate understanding of Godot's XR systems and SDG concepts
- Must include proper attribution for any assets used (textures, 3D models, data sources)

## Rubric
| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| **Technical Implementation** | 40% | Advanced algorithm design (e.g., procedural environment generation, complex gesture recognition, spatial audio systems, custom hand-tracking interactions). Sophisticated use of Godot's XR toolkit or other asset. Multiple custom nodes/systems showing SOLID principles. Complex state management and scene architecture. Effective performance optimization for mobile XR. Demonstrates significant self-directed learning of XR topics beyond course material. Clean, well-structured code. Excellent git workflow with meaningful, regular commits throughout development. Strong integration of SDG content with technical systems. | Implementation of moderately complex XR features (e.g., hand tracking, spatial UI design, basic gesture detection, spatial audio). Good use of Godot's built-in XR systems and nodes. Custom scripts showing good OOP practices. Basic visual effects. Evidence of self-directed learning. Regular, well-documented git commits. Good SDG content integration. Functional XR deployment to headset. | Basic XR feature implementation using primarily built-in Godot XR functionality. Some custom nodes. Simple hand tracking or controller input. Basic spatial interactions and UI. Adequate SDG representation. Basic version control usage. Functional deployment with acceptable performance. | Minimal working XR implementation. Limited interactions beyond basic controller input. Poor code structure. Sparse git usage. Weak SDG integration. Deployment works but with performance issues. | Non-functional XR implementation. Doesn't deploy to headset or crashes frequently. No version control. Code doesn't compile or run. No meaningful SDG content. |
| **User Experience & Creativity** | 30% | Highly innovative XR concept with strong SDG alignment. Exceptional attention to XR user interaction design (comfort, intuitive spatial UI, natural gestures). Professional-quality visual feedback and environmental design. Novel approach to communicating SDG concepts in XR. Outstanding comfort considerations (locomotion, UI placement, interaction ergonomics). Demonstrates deep understanding of XR platform capabilities and limitations. High degree of polish and refinement. Clear educational impact or awareness-raising value. | Good original concept with clear SDG purpose. Intuitive and comfortable XR interface. Meaningful visual/audio feedback. Good spatial UI design. Effective SDG communication. Shows creativity in XR implementation. Good platform integration and performance. Evidence of user testing and iteration. | Basic but complete XR concept. Functional interface and interactions. Simple feedback systems. Adequate SDG representation. Standard XR interaction patterns. Limited but acceptable comfort design. Some consideration of user experience. Meets basic requirements. | Minimal XR interaction design. Basic feedback. Poor comfort considerations. Weak SDG connection or unclear messaging. Poor platform integration. Limited user testing evident. | Incomplete or non-functional experience. Causes discomfort or disorientation. No meaningful SDG content. Unusable interface. |
| **Technical Documentation** | 30% | Comprehensive documentation, thorough feature documentation, clear setup and deployment instructions, known issues/limitations, performance analysis, XR-specific implementation details, SDG research and integration rationale. Professional video demonstration (5-10 minutes) showing all features, technical highlights, XR-specific functionality, and development process. Exemplary git history with regular, well-documented commits throughout development showing clear progression. All sources and assets properly cited. | Good documentation covering main systems and features. Solid setup guide and deployment instructions. Good quality video demo showing key features and code.

**Note on Team Projects**: 
- All team members must contribute equally and will be individually assessed
- Unequal contribution may result in different grades for team members
- Git commits will be used to verify contribution
