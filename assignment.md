# eXtended Reality Prototyping Assignment 2024

"Quest:SDG - Extended Reality for Sustainable Development"

![](images/questsdg.png)

For this assignment, you will demonstrate your creativity and technical competency with Godot and XR development by creating an interactive experience inspired by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Your project must be deployed to an XR headset, or mobile device and should educate, engage, or inspire action around one or more of the 17 SDGs.

This assignment builds on the Quest:SDG project developed over summer. You may choose to:

- **Extend Quest:SDG**: Add new features, goals, interactions, or systems to the existing project

- **Create a standalone experience**: Build your own SDG-focused XR application from scratch

Projects can be completed **individually or in teams of up to 3 students**.

## The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
1. No Poverty
2. Zero Hunger
3. Good Health and Well-being
4. Quality Education
5. Gender Equality
6. Clean Water and Sanitation
7. Affordable and Clean Energy
8. Decent Work and Economic Growth
9. Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
10. Reduced Inequalities
11. Sustainable Cities and Communities
12. Responsible Consumption and Production
13. Climate Action
14. Life Below Water
15. Life on Land
16. Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions
17. Partnerships for the Goals

**Note on Team Projects**: 
- All team members must contribute equally and will be individually assessed
- Unequal contribution may result in different grades for team members
- Git commits, task logs, and peer assessment will be used to verify contribution
- Teams that fail to work effectively will receive lower grades

## Assessment Methods
- Proposal review and feedback session (week 3)
- Mid-project check-in demonstration (week 8)
- Final in-class demonstration with Q&A
- Code review of git repository
- Evaluation of documentation and video submission
- Assessment of XR deployment and performance

## Resources
- Quest:SDG base project (available in course repository)
- Godot XR documentation: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/xr/
- UN SDG resources: https://sdgs.un.org/
- Meta Quest development guides
- Previous student projects showcase (will be shared in class)

## Important Notes
- Start early! XR development and deployment can be challenging
- Test on device frequently - performance in editor differs from headset
- Keep builds small - optimize assets and textures for mobile XR
- Commit to git regularly - not just at the end
- Cite all sources properly - plagiarism will result in automatic failure
- Quest 3 headsets available for checkout from equipment room
- Office hours: [Your schedule here] for technical support
- Extensions only granted for genuine emergencies with documentation

**The rubric features are indicative rather than exhaustive** - exceptional work may demonstrate excellence in ways not explicitly listed. Focus on showing mastery of XR development and Godot while meaningfully engaging with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
